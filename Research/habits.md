## Take-Aways:
  
* ### Small Breaks vs Big Breaks (Marathon vs Short Sprints)
    * Life happens
    * Everyone has responsibilities 
    * Lack of free time
    * Motivation is difficult
    * Start with the smallest amount of work possible
 * ### Volume > Perfection
    * Perfection slows you down
    * 90% of learning occurs during the first 60% of doing
    * Expanding horizons increases your ability to learn
    * Lots to show > nothing
 * ### Steal
    * We build on what we see
    * _Steal Like an Artist – Austin Kleon_
        * Good vs Bad stealing
        * Credit, not plagiarize
        * The life of a project
        * Is it worth stealing?
        * The secrets
    * Find projects you like the idea behind, see how they started
    * Steal code to see how it works, build it yourself
* ### Conscious Learning 
    * Practice -> Procrastination 
    * Learning is not linear
    * Have goals, don’t just doodle
    * Re-Learn
    * Fastest way to improve
* ### Rest
    * Burnout kills learning
    * Step away when stumped
    * Reading your projects after a break
* ### Feedback 
    * Best artists seek honest feedback/ criticism
    * Iteration > One and done
* ### Create what You Love
    * Make the projects that would inspire you
    * Create things you want to use
    * Intrinsic motivation
